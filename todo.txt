1. Buy domain (choice is up to you on whatever you think looks best as this has no effect except for looks and what people type in)
- radaudiopeoria.com - 11.28/yr
- radaudiodunlap.com - 11.28/yr

Other Examples:
- radaudio.io - 34.98/yr
- radaudio.org - 7.48/yr
- radaudio.net - 12.98/yr

.com generally more trusted/overall may be better suited

2. LLC
- Optional but highly recommended
- Can get insurance for your small business to protect expensive sound equipment
- Tax benefits (write offs for more equipment potentially)
- Information added to the website is automatically protected under copyright
- We cannot infringe upon other's copyrights/trademarks


3. Add Real Information
- We can get testimonials, pictures (with permission), and videos (embed linked via youtube would be a good option)
- Need to add a description for the about page for the company
- Maybe get a slogan of some kind or keep "level up your audio experience"
- Could create a calendar page on the contact us to show your availability?


4. Go Live
- Once the domain is added and all content is in order, I will go live and create the https webpage hosted on my GitHub
- I will also make the contact us button link to a site that will give ~50 free emails from people interested a month
    - I also need to add a captcha to not get hit by bots submitting the form
- I will add meta tags to the site and clean all URLs to ensure that the site comes up on google when searching for it
- I will add website analytics to see how many people are visiting the site to improve the meta tags and data for the search engine

5. Create business emails & Social Media
- To make it look more professional, I can create emails based on the domain that is purchased (ex - booking@radaudiopeoria.com)
- Create social media accounts to share more pictures/videos and link in the website

6. Branding and Logo
- We have logos and branding which look good but ensuring you're happy with it so we can finalize it is important
- This is so we can create stickers, t-shirts, hats, or whatever else you want with the official logo on it
